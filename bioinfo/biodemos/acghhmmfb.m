function states = acghhmmfb(Pi, A, B)
%ACGHHMMFB Generate states for a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) ACGHHMMDEMO
%
%   This calculates the alpha from the HMM defined by Pi, A,and B, and
%   sample the states from alpha backwards. In Viterbi, it finds the state
%   for max(alpha) in stead.
% 
%   A(N,N) is the transition probability matrix froma state i to state j
%   B(N,T) is the emission probability matrix (B(i,k) is the probability to
%   obtain the kth log2ratio when at the state i)
%   Pi(N,1) is the distribution probability for the initial state (Pi(i) is
%   the prbability to start in the state i).
% 
%   The function return states
