function varargout =  minspantree(varargin)
%MINSPANTREE finds the minimal spanning tree in graph.
%
%  MINSPANTREE method for BIOGRAPH objects extracts the adjacency matrix
%  and calls GRAPHMINSPANTREE function. All other input and output
%  arguments are analogous to GRAPHMINSPANTREE.
%
%  Remark: MINSPANTREE ignores the direction of the edges in the BIOGRAPH
%  object.
% 
%  See also graphminspantree.
